# SkillStake System Analysis & Fixes

## 1. Screenshot Verification System - STRICT FRAUD DETECTION ✅

### **Answer: NO, the system REJECTS game-unrelated screenshots**

The OCR verification system has **advanced fraud detection** that strictly validates screenshots:

#### **Multi-Layer Validation:**
- **Game-specific UI detection**: Checks for specific UI elements (PUBG orange/red UI, FIFA green field, COD contrast)
- **Edge density analysis**: Requires 35%+ edge density (games have complex interfaces)
- **Color complexity**: Must have 15,000+ unique colors (games are colorful)
- **Rectangular UI elements**: Minimum 5 rectangular shapes (buttons, HUD elements)
- **Resolution requirements**: Minimum 720x1280 pixels for mobile games
- **Aspect ratio validation**: Must be mobile game ratios (0.4-0.8)
- **Duplicate detection**: Checks against database of previously used screenshots

#### **Fraud Penalties:**
- **KSh 50-100 penalty** for fake/non-game screenshots
- **Automatic balance deduction** when fraud detected
- **Admin commission** from fraud penalties
- **Match cancellation** if both players submit fake screenshots
- **Progressive penalties** for repeat offenders

#### **Example Rejection Reasons:**
- "Screenshot too small - minimum 100KB required"
- "No game UI elements detected"
- "Invalid screenshot - not from specified game"
- "Duplicate screenshot detected - same image used before"
- "Screenshot failed strict validation - not a valid game screenshot"
