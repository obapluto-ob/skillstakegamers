# PayPal Production Setup - REAL MONEY

## CRITICAL: Current Status = SANDBOX (NO REAL MONEY)

### Step 1: Get Production Credentials
1. Go to https://developer.paypal.com
2. Switch from "Sandbox" to "Live" 
3. Create Production App
4. Get LIVE Client ID & Secret

### Step 2: Update Environment Variables
```env
# REPLACE THESE WITH PRODUCTION VALUES:
PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_LIVE_CLIENT_ID_HERE
PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET=YOUR_LIVE_CLIENT_SECRET_HERE
PAYPAL_BASE_URL=https://api.paypal.com

# Your Business PayPal Email
PAYPAL_BUSINESS_EMAIL=your-business@email.com
```

### Step 3: Verify Business Account
- Complete PayPal business verification
- Add bank account for withdrawals
- Set up webhook endpoints

### Step 4: Test Production
1. Make small test payment ($1)
2. Verify money reaches your PayPal business account
3. Verify user balance is credited correctly

## Security Checklist:
- [ ] SSL Certificate installed

## Current Risk:

## Action Required:
Switch to production PayPal credentials immediately to process real payments.
