# M-PESA VERIFICATION & FRAUD PREVENTION

## Current Verification Methods:

### 1. **MANUAL SCREENSHOT VERIFICATION** (Current)
**How it works:**
- User uploads M-Pesa receipt screenshot
- Admin manually reviews each screenshot
- Checks paybill (400200), account (1075794), amount
- Approves/rejects based on visual inspection

**Fraud Prevention:**
- ✅ Visual inspection of screenshot authenticity
- ✅ Amount verification
- ✅ Paybill/account number verification
- ❌ No duplicate detection
- ❌ No automated verification
- ❌ Relies on admin expertise

### 2. **ENHANCED MANUAL VERIFICATION** (Recommended)
**Additional Checks:**
- Screenshot hash comparison (detect duplicates)
- User deposit frequency analysis
- Phone number validation
- Amount pattern analysis
- Cross-reference with cooperative account

**Implementation:**
```python
# Fraud score calculation
- Duplicate screenshot: +80% fraud score
- >3 deposits/day: +30% fraud score  
- Round amounts >500: +20% fraud score
- Invalid phone: +30% fraud score
```

### 3. **COOPERATIVE ACCOUNT VERIFICATION** (Best)
**How it works:**
- User submits deposit claim
- Admin checks cooperative account statement
- Matches incoming M-Pesa with user claims
- Only approve if money actually received

**Process:**
1. User claims: "Sent KSh 500 at 2:30 PM"
2. Admin checks cooperative M-Pesa statement
3. Finds: "Received KSh 500 from 0712345678 at 2:30 PM"
4. Matches phone number with user account
5. Approves deposit

### 4. **M-PESA API INTEGRATION** (Future)
**Safaricom Daraja API:**
- Real-time transaction verification
- Automatic confirmation
- No fake screenshots possible
- Instant deposits

**Requirements:**
- Safaricom business account
- API credentials
- Technical integration
- Monthly API fees

## CURRENT FRAUD RISKS:

### **High Risk:**
- **Fake screenshots** (edited images)
- **Duplicate submissions** (same screenshot multiple times)
- **Wrong paybill** (money goes elsewhere)
- **Amount manipulation** (claim higher than sent)

### **Medium Risk:**
- **Timing fraud** (old screenshots)
- **Phone mismatch** (different sender number)
- **Frequency abuse** (multiple daily deposits)

### **Low Risk:**
- **Small amount fraud** (<KSh 100)
- **Reference errors** (wrong username)

## RECOMMENDED VERIFICATION PROCESS:

### **Step 1: Automated Checks**
```python
def verify_mpesa_deposit(screenshot, amount, phone):
    # Check for duplicates
    # Validate phone format
    # Analyze deposit frequency
    # Calculate fraud score
    return fraud_score
```

### **Step 2: Manual Review**
1. **Screenshot Analysis:**
   - Paybill: Must be 400200
   - Account: Must be 1075794
   - Amount: Must match claim
   - Timestamp: Within 24 hours
   - Quality: Not obviously edited

2. **Cooperative Account Check:**
   - Login to cooperative M-Pesa account
   - Check recent transactions
   - Match amount, time, sender phone
   - Confirm money actually received

### **Step 3: Approval Decision**
- **Auto-Approve:** Fraud score <20%, all checks pass
- **Manual Review:** Fraud score 20-60%
- **Auto-Reject:** Fraud score >60%, obvious fraud

## IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY:

### **Immediate (This Week):**
1. Add duplicate screenshot detection
2. Implement user deposit frequency limits
3. Create admin verification checklist
4. Cross-check with cooperative account

### **Short Term (This Month):**
1. Automated fraud scoring system
2. Phone number validation
3. Enhanced admin dashboard
4. Suspicious activity alerts

### **Long Term (Next 3 Months):**
1. M-Pesa API integration
2. Real-time verification
3. Automatic deposits
4. Advanced fraud detection

## SECURITY MEASURES:

### **Current Protection:**
- Manual admin review
- Screenshot requirement
- Paybill verification

### **Enhanced Protection:**
- Duplicate detection
- Fraud scoring
- Frequency limits
- Account cross-checking

### **Maximum Protection:**
