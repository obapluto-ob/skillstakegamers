    referrer = get_referrer(loser_id)
    if referrer:
        commission = bet_amount * 0.04  # 4% of loss
        credit_referrer(referrer, commission)

---

## ðŸ’¡ **BUSINESS LOGIC**

### **Why This System Works:**
1. **User Acquisition**: Referrers actively bring new users
2. **Revenue Sharing**: Platform shares revenue to grow user base
3. **Sustainable**: 4% commission is small enough to not hurt users
4. **Viral Growth**: Successful referrers become advocates
5. **Long-term Value**: Ongoing commissions vs one-time bonuses

### **Platform Profitability:**
- **Break-even**: After referred user loses KSh 750 (30 Ã· 0.04)
- **Profit**: Every loss after KSh 750 is pure profit
- **Average user**: Loses KSh 2000+ over lifetime = KSh 50+ profit per referral

This system ensures both users and platform benefit from growth! ðŸš€
